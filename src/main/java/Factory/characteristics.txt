Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class.
1. Factory design pattern provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation.
2. Factory pattern removes the instantiation of actual implementation classes from client code. Factory pattern makes our code more robust, less coupled and easy to extend.
3. Factory pattern provides abstraction between implementation and client classes through inheritance.
