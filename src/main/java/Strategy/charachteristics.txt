In Strategy pattern, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time. This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern.
In Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object.
The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.

1.Defines a set of encapsulated algorithms that can be swapped to carry out a specific behaviour.
2.The Strategy is simply implemented as an interface, so that we can swap Concrete Strategy in and out without effecting our Context.
3.A good use of the Strategy pattern would be saving files in different formats, running various sorting algorithms, or file compression.
