The general concept behind dependency injection is called Inversion of Control.
According to this concept a class should not configure its dependencies statically but should be configured from the outside.
A Java class has a dependency on another class, if it uses an instance of this class. We call this a _class dependency.
For example, a class which accesses a logger service has a dependency on this service class.

Dependency injection can be performed on:
1.the constructor of the class (construction injection)
2.a field (field injection)
3.the parameters of a method (method injection)
