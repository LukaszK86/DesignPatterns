The Facade pattern basically says that you should simplify your methods so that much of what is done is in the background.
In technical terms you should decouple the client from the sub components needed to perform an operation.

1. Facade design pattern should be applied for similar kind of interfaces,
its purpose is to provide a single interface rather than multiple interfaces that does the similar kind of jobs.
2. Facade design pattern can be applied at any point of development, usually when the number of interfaces grow and system gets complex.
